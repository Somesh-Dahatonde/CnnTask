We are assigning you a paid task to assess your technical abilities, coding skills, and code quality before making a final hiring decision. You need to complete the following tasks within 2 to 3 days:

Task Details:

- Create a landing page for our website using React, Node.js, and Next.js.
  Host the landing page on our AWS server.

- Purchase a 1-year SSL certificate (CCN will cover the cost) and install it on the AWS server.

  The landing page should display our course details and include multiple buttons labeled "Register for DEMO Batch" to capture student leads.

- When a student clicks on the registration button, they must provide their photo, name, location, email, and mobile number.
- The photo upload should allow the student to choose an image from their camera or gallery and attach it to the registration form.
- Implement OTP authentication for both mobile number and email verification.
- After successful OTP verification, the student should be redirected to the payment page to pay ₹100 via CCN’s PhonePe Business - - API to confirm their demo seat.
- After successful payment, the student must enter their Aadhar card number, which should be verified using the government Aadhar portal via our purchased third-party API.
- Once the Aadhar authentication is successful:
- An invoice should be generated with the student’s Aadhar card name.
- A registration form should be generated confirming the demo seat booking.
- The student should receive a confirmation email & WhatsApp message with:
- Their invoice and registration form.
- CCN should also receive an email at info@ccnmail.in with:
- The student’s registration form and invoice.
- Use our official APIs for WhatsApp Business, PhonePe Business, email integration, mobile OTP authentication, and Aadhar card authentication (we will provide access).
- The invoice should include the digital signatures of the accountant and director.
- All captured leads should be displayed on our Strapi dashboard.
- - The database should be MySQL.
- Integrate Google Tag Manager for Google Ads tracking.
- The landing page must be attractive, responsive, and optimized for fast loading.
- Write all APIs yourself—do not use any free APIs or plugins as shortcuts.
- After the landing page is completed, we will review the full code to ensure that:
- No code is copied from external sources.
- No free third-party APIs are used.
- These are basic tasks that every developer should be able to complete.
- Kindly complete the landing page as soon as possible and make it live. Once we review your work, we will proceed with sending your offer letter.

Best of luck!
